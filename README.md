Provides an easy interface to clear the CynderHost CDN cache automatically and manually.

== Description ==

This plugin is only compatible with functional sites hosted on [CynderHost High Performance](https://cynderhost.com/high-performance-hosting).

This will also add a button to the admin interface allowing you to purge the cache manually.

An API key is required for this plugin to work, which you can obtain from the hosting panel for your site under "CDN"
