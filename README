Provides an easy interface to clear the CynderHost CDN cache automatically and manually.

== Description ==

This plugin is only compatible with functional sites hosted on CynderHost High Performance.

This plugin will use the CynderHost HP API (https://api.cynderhost.com/high-performance/cache/cdn/purge/) to purge the cache automatically when a post is published, updated, or delete, and when a plugin is installed. This will also add a button to the admin interface allowing you to purge the cache manually.
